# Investment
A collection of the investment protfolios that I have contributed to.
My contribution can be found in both of the portfolios in the 4th Chapter, Passive Component, where I explain all the mathematical methods that I have used in order to come up with the weights assignment.
These portfolios performed very well, reaching an yearly alpha of 4%.
